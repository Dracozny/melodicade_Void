# Melodicade Void
A portable 6+ octave, 3D printed, velocity sensitive MIDI keyboard and synthesizer, using Hall Efect mechanical key-switches (<a href="https://github.com/riskable/void_switch">Void Switches</a>) arranged in the Wicki-Hayden button layout.


# In Development
I am still doing some experimentation at the breadboard level and have yet to touch the code.
